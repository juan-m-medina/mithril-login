# Mithril Login Form

This is a sample application showing a basic login webpage to illustrate a general app using Mithril.

## Description

The goal of this application was to test the capabilities of Mithril. Initial implementation was all a single HTML page, but quickly evolved into a regular Javascript project format.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A working `nodejs/npm` environment.
* Optionally, there are basic settings for `Visual Studio Code`.

### Installing

* Clone or for the project from the original <repository:https://github.com/juan-m-medina/mithril-login>.
* From the root, run the basic node setup.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

### Executing program

* From the root folder run the `npm` `build` task to compile the project into the `dist` folder.

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

* Then again from the command line you can server the `dist` folder using `npx`:

    ```shell
    npx serve dist
    ```

    This will by default serve your app on <http://localhost:3000>.

* Alternatively if using *Visual Studio Code*, you can use the *Live Server* extension. The repository includes a Visual Studio Code configuration setup for that, which runs the application on <http://localhost:5500>.
